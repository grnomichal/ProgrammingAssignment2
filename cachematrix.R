## Matrix inversion is usually a costly computation and there may be some benefit to caching the inverse of a matrix rather than compute it repeatedly. 
## This R script contains a pair of functions that cache the inverse of a matrix.


## 'makeCacheMatrix' function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.

## This function creates a list containing a function to
## 1. set the value of the matrix
## 2. get the value of the matrix
## 3. set the value of the inverse of the matrix
## 4. get the value of the inverse of the matrix

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  
  inv <- NULL
  set <- function(y) {
    x <<- y
    inv <<- NULL
  }
  get <- function() x
  setinv <- function(inverse) inv <<- inverse
  getinv <- function() inv
  list(set = set, get = get,
       setinv = setinv,
       getinv = getinv)
  
}



## 'cacheSolve' function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix above. 
## If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), then the cachesolve should retrieve the inverse from the cache.
## Computing the inverse of a square matrix is done with the solve function.

## This function assumes that the matrix is always invertible.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
  
  inv <- x$getinv()
  if(!is.null(inv)) {
    message("getting cached data")
    return(inv)
  }
  data <- x$get()
  inv <- solve(data)
  x$setinv(inv)
  inv
  
}
